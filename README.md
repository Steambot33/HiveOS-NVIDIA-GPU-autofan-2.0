# Install
- Go to ```/home/user``` directory on your HiveOS ( ```cd /home/user```). Check current dir by command ```pwd```.
For navigation use commands : ```cd ~``` (go to home dir),  ```cd ..``` (level up), ```cd dir``` (move to dir)

- run script in GHOST mode (like service) by printing "y"

# Settings
 - ```DELAY``` - time delay for fan control (in seconds)
 - ```MIN_SPEED``` - minimum possible fan speed (in %)
 - ```MIN_TEMP``` - GPU temperature at which the minimum coefficient is applied
 - ```MAX_TEMP``` - GPU temperature at which the maximum coefficient is applied
 - ```MIN_COEF``` - minimum coefficient
 - ```MAX_COEF``` - maximum coefficient


# Run with keys

-s 		- start setup settings (terminate by Ctrl+C). Don't need restart the script.

-g 		- running script in GHOST mode or SCREEN mode (terminate by Ctrl+C)

-c 		- checking current script status and current GPU temperature/fan speed, updated every DELAY time (terminate by Ctrl+C)

-r 		- running script in SCREEN mode (terminate by Ctrl+C)

  Run without any keys has follow steps: 
  - start setup settings
  - checking starup status
